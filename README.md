# Working Group

- if you would like to join the working group than contact me at https://cal.com/cybersader 

## Current Projects, Ideas, Tasks

### Tasks

Check the `Projects` tab for current tasks.

- GH-1 - just a test
- #1
### Projects

<ins>Easy: </ins>

> You should be able to start adding to these now

- Starter vaults for for SecOps, couple/family productivity, personal branding, GRC, and more
- Test Obsidian plugins with application firewall to watch traffic
- Curate Obsidian plugins
- Curate workflows, examples, and user stories

<ins>Medium:</ins>

> With time, you can solve some of these with AI.  They just take time.

- [github.com > cybersader/obsidian-tag-and-folder-mapper](https://github.com/cybersader/obsidian-tag-and-folder-mapper)
	- Plugin to map/sync folders and tags (multiple hierarchies so we aren't limited by folders)
- [github.com > cybersader/Crosswalker: A tool for crosswalking cybersecurity frameworks and translating them into an Obsidian vault (Other names: LavaLinker](https://github.com/cybersader/Crosswalker)
- Frameworker - `map evidence to frameworks in one place`
	- Obsidian plugin or workflow to define metadata per framework <-> obsidian_note connection. This would be step 1 of turning Obsidian into a full-fledged GRC database.
	- Ex:
		- You could have a `CIS 1.1.md` note generated from the above [crosswalker](https://github.com/cybersader/Crosswalker) tool and a `Evidence_containing_note.md`.  Linking from one note to another isn't good enough.  Instead, we can include metadata above the connection in the link syntax are in an intermediate file.  
		- From `Evidence_containing_note.md`, we would make a link like `framework_here:: [CIS 1.1](../CIS 1.1.md) {"reviewer": "Person", "status":"covered"}`.  

<ins>Hard / Seasoned-Developer / Pentester:</ins>

>These rely on complex technical problems or complete architectures from the ground up

- Test risks of Obsidian application
- Fix SMB share and other problems by implementing CRDT-based reconciler for file system like OneNote uses.  Conflict handling for multiple user situations like corporate without needing to go to a block-baswd system like Notion
- User management layer on-top of browser-based Obsidian (linuxserver container like what KASM workspaces uses).  This would make Enterprise use with Obsidian possible (collaboration and accessibility with security)

# General Obsidian & Workflow

## 0) Obsidian Starters & Templates

> As I build template repos in GitHub, I've been using the below repo template I made to fast-track the process and have consistency
- [github.com > cybersader/obsidian-vault-template-template: Obsidian template for vault templates for GitHub](https://github.com/cybersader/obsidian-vault-template-template)

### Starter Vaults

#### (Starter Vaults) Corporate, Enterprise

- [github.com > cybersader/obsidian-secops-vault-template](https://github.com/cybersader/obsidian-secops-vault-template) - corporate template in progress
- [ ] start GRC template repo âž• 2025-05-04
	

#### (Starter Vaults) Personal Branding

- [github.com > cybersader/cyberbase: My public and contributable base/wiki/digital garden for cybersecurity](https://github.com/cybersader/cyberbase) - my public vault that I use as a website

- [ ] Add "cyberbase" starter (need to make a repo for this) âž• 2025-05-04

#### (Starter Vaults) Community Vault

- [ ] Develop a community vault repo âž• 2025-05-04

#### (Starter Vaults) Mobile Vaults

- [ ] Need to do more testing to build a good mobile vault that is performant, has good buttons, etc. âž• 2025-05-04

## 1) Core Activities

### 1.1) Knowledge Capture

- Obsidian web clipper templates
- Useful ancillary tools, platforms, workflows

### 1.2) Knowledge Work

- Cybersecurity-specific Obsidian plugins
- Knowledge platforms and cyber
	- Organizing knowledge related to cyber - unique problems and solutions for this

### 1.3) Knowledge Sharing & Output

- Obsidian Publish templates
- Using GitHub for community wiki and contributions

## 2) Organizing Cyber-Related Knowledge & Information

> These are example taxonomies that can be used or modified to organize knowledge or information around particular subjects.

- SEACOW(r) - a meta framework for organizing knowledge platforms
- PARA - a folder structure oriented towards what is actionable vs non-actionable knowledge
- Zettelkasten - writer and research focused workflow or approach
- LATCH
- ACE
- ARCO
- STIR

## 3) Obsidian Plugins

- [obsidianstats.com > Explore New](https://www.obsidianstats.com/) - Best place to explore and bookmark Obsidian plugins

# By Solution

## Task management

- do individual task management in obsidian and escalate to longer term tasks and project MGMT tooling when necessary

## GRC

- map frameworks as notes in obsidian and turn Obsidian into your core evidence mapping and risk management platform.  Store your evidence/knowledge right alongside the frameworks you map to
- set up automations alongside your vault
- Use Obsidian to help other understand how to organize files

## IR

- Set up a backup vault using obsidian Publish or sync with a password that the CISO or chief security related officer only has access to
- Give responders access to the vault to help onboard, see playbooks, and quickly become valuable during the event

## Awareness

- set up games via the education section below for awareness or training

## SecOps

- set up your core working, wiki, and knowledge management environment in Obsidian and collaborate in real time.  this part is hard but game changing
- Store tutorials and document 
- replace using OneDrive or file explorer for working with knowledge content and notes and docs

## Application Security

- make program documentation in Obsidian and format to work with GitHub

## Penetration

- streamline test reporting and documentation
- organize pen testing knowledge for easier sharing and collaboration
